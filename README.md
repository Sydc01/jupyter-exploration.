# jupyter-exploration


This session starts with me creating a GitHub account by visiting the GitHub website, signing up with my email, and verifying it. After logging in, I clicked the "+" icon and selected "New repository." I named the repository "Jupyter-exploratipn," set it to public, and initialized it with a README file.
